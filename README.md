# How to setup the bot
1. Clone this reposytory or download zip file.
2. Run telegram and create bot with BotFather and copy your token.
3. Go to Google Lab and create API key.
4. Add your token and api key to config.py file.
5. Then run gemini_launcher.bat
Done. Type /start in your bot and it will answer you and bot working very slow for me. Wait 10-20 seconds for answer.
